# chess
just a chess game


optional improvements: 

create "rookish" "bishopish" interface and implement it in queen, rook and bishop (the refresh_checks, and can_move methods are similar in queen-bishop, queen-rook)

not handled: 

- castle king's side/queen's side
- pawn turns to a chosen piece
- pawns can hit pawns in the middle of the board in a weird way, I did not do that...

there may be unknown bugs...
