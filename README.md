# chess
A Chess game rendered in the terminal.

optional improvements: 

create "rookish" "bishopish" interface and include it in queen (both), rook (rookish) and bishop (bishopish). The refresh_checks, and can_move methods are similar in queen-bishop, queen-rook.

not handled: 

- castle king's side/queen's side
- pawn promotion
- en passant
- checking the conditions for check mate (it's tough, not done yet :), just finish the game when you can not move to anywhere
